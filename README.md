# R-and-Python-Data-Project
Final Data Project for R and Python course at CSPH


In this project, you will be analyzing Twitter data to understand temporal and spatial variation patterns in the Zika Virus. A nice description of the Zika virus can be found in Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus). Key things to note about Zika virus:

1. There is no vaccine or medicine that can be used to prevent infection by the virus. 
2. Zika poses a high risk of transmission from pregnant mothers to the baby.
3. Zika infection has serious potential health eﬀects, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barr´e syndrome.

There have been epidemics of Zika virus in Micronesia in 2007, French Polynesia and the Easter Islands in 2013–2014. In public health, one of the visionary goals is to see if public health oﬃcials can use Twitter to predict disease outbreaks (e.g., http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2353). While that can be viewed as a machine learning problem, in this project, we will accomplish an intermediary goal, which is to do a descriptive study of twitter mentions of Zika virus both geographically as well as over time. This will expand your data munging/wrangling skills in R and Python. Some tips:

1. Given that this is a class on R and Python, I expect the project to be done in R and/or Python.
2. As part of the project, I would like to you to set up a github repository (https: //github.com/) to store the code you used for your project.
3. You should read http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2014/07/twitter-analytics/ to learn more about getting data from Twitter. This will be Python-based.
4. While most of the data wrangling/processing stuﬀ we cover in class is from Python, the packages dplyr and tidyr are available in R to do similar tasks.
